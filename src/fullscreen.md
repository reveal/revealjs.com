### Fullscreen mode

There's built-in support for fullscreen mode. Press »F« on your keyboard to view your presentation in fullscreen mode. Once in fullscreen mode, press the »ESC« key to exit.

Try it out below. Note that this example uses an [embedded](/presentation-size/#embedded) presentation, you will need to click to give it focus before pressing F.

<div class="reveal reveal-example">
  <div class="slides">
    <section>Click here to focus, then the F key.</section>
    <section>Slide 2</section>
  </div>
</div>
